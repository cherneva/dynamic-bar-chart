Bar Chart build with Raphael JS
=================

Bar chart created using RaphaelJS

This example uses raphael-min.js, g.raphael-min.js and g.bar-min.js to draw a chart from two columns. The data in the example is an Annual Chart for a Farm Shop.
It compares the ammount of fruits and veggies both each quarter. Once the chart is displayed the bars can be dragged in order to adjust the ammounts. Then the value in the input fields is updated.
